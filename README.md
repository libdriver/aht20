## LibDriver AHT20

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/aht20/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

As a new generation of temperature and humidity sensors, AHT20 sets a new standard in terms of size and performance: a two-row flat pin less SMD package suitable for reflow soldering, bottom face 3x3mm, height 1.0mm.The sensor outputs calibrated digital signals in standard IIC format.AHT20 is equipped with a newly designed ASIC dedicated chip, an improved MEMS semiconductor capacitive humidity sensor element and a standard on-chip temperature sensor element. Its performance has been greatly improved or even exceeded the reliability level of the previous generation of sensors. A generation of temperature and humidity sensors have been improved to make their performance more stable in harsh environments.Each sensor is calibrated and tested, and the product lot number is printed on the surface of the product. Due to improvements and miniaturization of the sensor, it is more cost-effective, and ultimately all devices will benefit from cutting-edge energy-saving operation modes. It is used in consumer electronics, medical, automotive, industrial, meteorological and other fields.

LibDriver AHT20 is a full-featured driver of AHT20 launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of reading temperature and relative humidity. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver AHT20 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver AHT20 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver AHT20 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver AHT20 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver AHT20 offline document.

/datasheet includes AHT20 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_aht20_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float temperature;
uint8_t humidity;

res = aht20_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    aht20_interface_delay_ms(2000);
    res = aht20_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (uint8_t *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)aht20_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    aht20_interface_debug_print("aht20: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    aht20_interface_debug_print("aht20: humidity is %d%%.\n", humidity); 
    
    ...
        
}

...

(void)aht20_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
